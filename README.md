# StillCam

A library mod for [Phantom Brigade](https://braceyourselfgames.com/phantom-brigade/) that prevents the camera from moving when you select a unit.

It is compatible with game release version **2.0.0**. It works with both the Steam and Epic installs of the game. All library mods are fragile and susceptible to breakage whenever a new version is released.

When a unit is selected the game will move the camera to center the unit in the screen. The auto camera focus game option prevents the camera from moving on events like unit destruction and crashing but does not prevent this auto-centering on selection behavior. This mod extends the game option so that the camera is not moved even on unit selection. There are several ways to select a unit, from directly clicking on one to several keyboard options. This mod covers them all.

The auto camera focus game option is enabled by default. To turn it off, go to Main Menu > Options > Game and scroll down.
